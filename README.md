# Small-Business-Sales

Using data from a local small business, I analyze their strenghts and weaknesses, and make recommendations of how they should proceed in the future based on their sales and revenue.

This business sells a range of items ranging from jewelry and furniture to Christmas items and Skin Care goods. After downloading the CSV of the business's sales data from Kaggle, I loaded it into R Studio and used SQL to data mine.
